# B
- Starting a blog, why
    - be more visible online
    - make personal projects more legible
    - interesting to journal history of projects
    - always wanted to, enjoy reading other people's blogs

# M
- Needed a blog system
    - requirements
    - previously tried other generators, didn't like them (Hugo, Jekyll)
        - too opaque
        - themes have inconsistent features
        - themes are annoying to manage
        - annoying dependencies

- might as well just generate my own
- process of generating it with o1
- what needed tweaked after that

# E
- Blog generator turned out pretty nicely
- AI is pretty neat
- Hope to post more in the future about other projects
